# Three examples of loop with range

# Example #1
for index in range(10):
    print(index + 1)

# Example #2
shopping_list = ('eggs', 'milk', 'apples', 'bananas', 'bread')
for x in range(len(shopping_list)):
    print(shopping_list[x])

# Example #3
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
for num in numbers:
        print(num)
